## ✨ Features

This demo site is packed with diverse functionalities to cover a wide range of test automation scenarios:

-   **🔐 Login and Registration**: Simulate user authentication flows. Practice testing input fields, button clicks, form submissions, and validation messages for both successful and erroneous login/registration attempts.
-   **📝 Forms**: Engage with various form elements, including text inputs, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and date pickers. Focus on testing form submission, data validation, and error handling.
-   **🎛️ Widgets**: Interact with a rich collection of UI components such as accordions, auto-complete fields, date pickers, sliders, progress bars, tabs, tooltips, menus, and select menus. Test their states, interactions, and dynamic behaviors.
-   **🔗 Web Elements**: Explore fundamental web elements like text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, web tables, buttons, links (including broken links), image uploads, downloads, and elements with dynamic properties. This section is perfect for practicing element identification and interaction.
-   **🖐️ Interactions**: Experiment with advanced interactions such as sortable, selectable, resizable, droppable, and draggable elements. These features challenge your automation scripts to handle complex user gestures.

## 🚀 Usage

This project is specifically designed as a versatile test automation playground. Here's how you can leverage it:

-   **Manual Exploration**: Browse through different sections of the site to understand the various web elements and interactions available.
-   **Automated Testing Practice**: Write automated test scripts using your preferred testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, Cypress) to interact with the elements on this site.
    -   **Example Scenarios**: Simulate user logins, fill out forms, interact with sliders, drag-and-drop elements, verify text content, check element visibility, and handle dynamic content.
    -   **Error Handling**: Practice writing assertions for expected outcomes and error conditions.
-   **Demonstration**: Use this site to demonstrate your test automation capabilities to others.

## 🧩 Components Overview

The application is structured with several key components, each serving a specific purpose for testing:

-   **Home**: The main landing page, providing an entry point and navigation links to all other sections of the site. Ideal for testing navigation and initial page loads.
-   **Login**: A mock login interface to simulate user authentication. Test valid/invalid credentials, error messages, and redirection.
-   **Register**: A mock registration form for new user sign-ups. Test form validation, submission, and account creation flows.
-   **Forms**: A dedicated page containing various form elements. Practice data input, form submission, and validation rules.
-   **Widgets**: A collection of interactive UI widgets. Test dynamic behaviors, state changes, and user interactions with these components.
-   **Web Elements**: A page showcasing fundamental web elements. Focus on basic element identification, interaction, and property verification.
-   **Interactions**: A playground for testing advanced user interactions like drag-and-drop, resizing, and sorting. Essential for robust UI automation.
